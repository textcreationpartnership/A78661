            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> ANSWER OF The Right honourable the Earle of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke and the reſt of the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to the Kings Majeſties late Queries, about Church-government.</head>
            <p>THe Diſtractions of this Kingdome is (as we hope) at a full end and period, and the ſed expreſſions of Warre, begins to ring with a tryumphant Eccho of Peace: <pb facs="tcp:159941:3"/>therefore, the greateſt Object, which we have now to fixe our eyes upon, will be, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a pure and firme Government in Church and Common wealth; which God grant, that ſo the Light of the Goſpel, may appear in its full luſtre, and ſhine forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly throughout all His Majeſties Realmes and Dominions.</p>
            <p>But ſome obſtructions doth ariſe for the retarding of this great and bleſſed work: For the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty will by no meanes poſſible hearken or condiſcend to the Deſires of the Engliſh Commiſsioners about the ſetling of Church-Government in the Kingdome of England; and refuſeth to hear the Engliſh Miniſters preach, though they adminiſtred the word in the ſame houſe where his Maieſty lay.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Marſhall, (that famous and learned Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) deſired to know his Maieſties reaſon, why Hee would not hear the Engliſh Divines as well as the Scots, both Nations having entred into a Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for the preſervation and defence of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med Religion, now exercized in both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty replyed, that hee had ſetled the Forme of Church-Government within the Kingdome of Scotland and had given his Royall aſſent thereunto; but for the Government of the Church of England, as it is now exercized, Hee never gave his aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:159941:3"/>
            <p>And therefore, He hoped, they will allow Him Hi, Conſcience, being not willing to bee forced to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe that which Hee at preſent approves not in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not hath given his Royall aſſent unto: But its hoped, few dayes will produce, a gallant concurrence betwixt the Kings Majeſty, and our renowned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Loyall Subjects, and Englands famous Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees.</p>
            <p>One thing very remarkable, I ſhall here recite and Memorable and deſervedly to be ſpoken to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Nation, is the departure of our Brethren of Scotland, and like worthy of laſting memorie was the proceedings of the Parliament of that Kingdome to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all matter of ſcruple concerning the diſpoſe of his Majeſties Perſon.</p>
            <p>Our Gariſons in the North are peaceably delivered to us, Carlisle and Barwick ſlighted, and the Scottiſh army marching with all the convenient ſpeed that may be quite out of the Kingdome. And ſo commendabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was the carriage of Generall Leven towards the coune try, that he made Proclamation, that if any mony were due to them from the Souldiery, they ſhould have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of Scotland have had a great debate about reducing of their Army, and wee heare they are come to this reſult, That their foot ſhall be reduced to ſix thouſand, and their horſe to two thouſand, which Forces are to be imployed againſt Antrim and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Gourdeons, which keepe themſelves in the Hill Country, and Generall Lesley, Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lesley, and Major Generall Middleton are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them in chiefe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:159941:4"/>
            <p>The right honourable the Earl of Pembroke doth deport himſelfe gallantly, with the Kings Majeſty, having lately declared his great loyalty and faithfulneſſe towards his Soveraign, by endeavouring to renew a right underſtanding betwixt the King and His People; declaring, that if his Maieſty will be pleaſed to hearken to the advice of his great Councell the Parliament, and to unite himſelf with them, he were confident, the love of all his Subjects would increaſe in ſuch abundant meaſure, that nothing would be wanting in them, for the advancing of his Honour and Dignity, and his Royall Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that ſhall ſucceed him.</p>
            <p>And further, his Lordſhip declared, that for his own part, as hee had hitherto appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf a loyall ſubiect to his Majeſty, &amp; a faithfull Patriot to his Country, ſo he were reſolved to continue his loyalty, and faithful integrity to his death, and that nothing ſhould be wanting in him, which might any wayes tend to the honour of his Prince, and welfare of his Country.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip, at the cloſe of all, deſired
<pb facs="tcp:159941:4"/>his Maieſty to hearken to his great Councel the Parliament of England, it being the only way to make him a glorious Prince, and his ſubiects a happy people.</p>
            <p>When the Commiſſioners of Scotland parted with the King, and reſigned him up to the Engliſh Commiſſioners, they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Declaration to his Maieſty, being grounded upon the return from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, as was conceived; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported many particulars, ſome of them were, that his Maieſty came to the Scots Armie, without knowledge or conſent of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Scotland; that in caſe he ſign the Propoſitions, and take the Covenant, his Royal perſon and poſterity ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>His Maieſty was much diſpleaſed (as is ſaid) at what he received.</p>
            <p>His Maieſty is to lye at Nottingham this inſtant Fryday, with all his gallant Traine, the Convoy conſiſting of nine hundred horſe, commanded by Colonell Graves, and vpon Tueſday next (at the furtheſt) they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at Holmby, where his Maieſty is to remain during pleaſure.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:159941:5"/>
            <p>The honourable houſes of Parliament have Ordered, that the Committee which attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, be deſired to haue regard to the low condition of the Kingdom, in the expences of their journey. And the houſe reſolved not to ſettle his Majeſties Houſhold at Holmby.</p>
            <p>It is ſuppoſed his Excellency Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairfax will meet the King at Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham, and accompany him to Holmby, at which place, great preparations are making for the entertainment of our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>The Cavies in the North, gives out ſtrange language againſt the Parliament, and talketh much of the Northern Armies; but alas, their malipert tongues will loon be ſilenced; for Generall Leven is going to viſit the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Rout under Kilketto, having a gallant Army of Horſe and Foot.</p>
